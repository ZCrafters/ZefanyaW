## 2024-05-22 - Layout Thrashing in Animation
**Learning:** Animated elements using `left`/`top` properties trigger layout calculations on every frame. CSS Transitions on these properties compound the issue by forcing layout throughout the transition duration.
**Action:** Always prefer `transform: translate3d(...)` for moving elements. It triggers Composite (and sometimes Paint) but skips Layout. Remove CSS transitions when JavaScript is handling the interpolation/physics to avoid conflicts and double-work.
